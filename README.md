## 🚀 The Core Engine

AutoMotion isn't just about recording faults; it's about **Predictive Action** and **Rapid Response**.

- **🚦 Line Control Hub**: A real-time Production Board (Kanban) to monitor active equipment failures and specialized squad workloads.
- **🔩 Factory Asset Enrollment**: A centralized inventory of CNC Machines, Robotic Arms, and Paint Booths with full technical genealogy.
- **📅 Service Master-Schedule**: A calendar-driven preventive maintenance system to ensure zero-downtime operations.
- **⚡ Smart Routing**: Automatic workload distribution among specialized squads: **Mechanical**, **Electrical**, **IT Support**, and **Facilities**.

## 🏭 Day in the Life: A Walkthrough

#### 1. Checking the Line Integrity
Head to the **Production Board**. The KPI cards at the top immediately signal the health of the plant. Moving a "CNC Machine vibration issue" from **New** to **In Progress** signals to the floor that a technician is on-site.

#### 2. Managing the Fleet
In the **Line Assets** tab, every machine counts. You can register a new Robotic Unit in seconds—the form is even pre-filled with automotive defaults like "Line 5 Welding Unit" to keep your demo flowing smoothly.

#### 3. Preventive Precision
Open the **Service Schedule**. A glance at the calendar reveals upcoming inspections. Overdue tasks are pulsed in high-visibility red, ensuring no air compressor or hydraulic press goes unmaintained.

#### 4. The Edge Case: Decommissioning
When a critical asset hits the "Scrap" column on the board, the system carries out an **Automatic Decommissioning Flow**, marking the actual production machine as "Scrapped" in the inventory—no manual sync needed.
